# Hello, I'm AndrÃ©, welcome to my portfolio ðŸ“š

My name is AndrÃ© Pereira, I'm a researcher and data scientist. This GitHub account serves as my portfolio, where I store code that I wrote for published, non-private projects. The data handled/analysed/generated are not publicly available except where noted. This is not my working GitHub account. Thank you for your interest!

* **"Generate master edgelist from Cayo Santiago data"**: R script to generate a master edgelist from the raw data of the Cayo Santiago Rhesus macaque population, resulting in a *processed dataset of 125K+ dyads*.

* **"Generate edgelist from mountain gorilla data"**: R script to generate an edgelist from the raw data of the mountain gorilla population from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, resulting in a *processed dataset of 1.8K dyads*.

* **"Chimpanzee lipsmacks"**: MATLAB script to load and process chimpanzee lip-smack *video data* and to conduct *frequency analysis*; R script to visually find the peak rate of lip-smack rhythm within populations, and to build a *generalised linear mixed model* with contrasts to test for differences in lip-smack rhythm between chimpanzee populations.

* **"Group augmentation agent-based models"**: R script to generate an *agent-based model* that simulates various group-augmentation strategies, write it into a function, and call the function from another script.

* **"Kinship composition and social structure in Rhesus macaques"**: R scripts to conduct *Bayesian social network analysis* using BISoN and *extract network metrics from each sample of the posterior distribution* of the social network; fit *multiple Bayesian regression models into a single mathematical object* to test for a relationship between kinship composition and social structure in the population of Rhesus macaques from Cayo Santiago; generate *two agent-based models* that allowed us to simulate the aforementioned relationship in a controled environment with and without the empirical limitations; to confirm that the mechanism for the agent-based models are working as intended.

* **"Kinship composition in mammals"**: R script to *create the dataset analysed* and to run the *Bayesian phylogenetic analysis*.

* **"Ageing and social structure"**: R script to generate an *agent-based model* that allowed us to simulate the relationship between the age structure of a social network and its social structure in a controled environment with and without the empirical limitations of the data of Rhesus macaques from the Cayo Santiago population.

* **"Shiny app ageing and social structure"**: R script to create and launch a *Shiny app* where users can operate the *agent-based model* mentioned in the previous project using a GUI. Link for the app is included in the *readme*.

* **"Tourism influences mountain gorilla sociality"**: R script to run *Bayesian regression models* with *hypothesis testing with Bayes factor* to assess the influence of the presence and proximity of tourists in the social behaviour of the mountain gorilla from the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park population.
